# My Personal Project

## Shoe Inventory Tracker

I started collecting shoes since I became a teenager.
From my knowledge, a lot of shoes are reminiscent of
something such as the first sneaker of a specific model
that was created or a special moment in the career of
a particular athlete or player.

### What will the application do?

My project is a shoe inventory tracker for users like
me who love collecting shoes. I aim to create an app
that can do the following:

#### User story

- As a user, I want to be able to add new shoes to my
collection
- As a user, I want to be able to indicate which shoes
I am willing to sell and at what price
- As a user, I want to be able to indicate which shoes
I am willing to keep in my personal collection
- As a user, I want to be able to get a list of shoes
currently in my collection
- As a user, I want to be able to remove shoes from
my collection
- As a user, I want to be able to check the number of shoes I have sold before
- As a user, I want to be able to add shoes to a wishlist
- As a user, I want to be able to get some information
about the shoe such as name of model, type, retail price
and current value

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts. 

### Who will use it?

Like I mentioned, this application can be used by other
***'sneakerheads'*** (people who like collecting shoes) to 
keep track of their collections and also by *people 
who sell shoes* to keep track of what they have in their
inventories.

### Why is this project of interest to you?

I have been collecting sneakers for years now and since
I now own a lot of shoes, it is difficult to keep track
of each and every shoe I have. Therefore, to keep an
organized tab of my shoe collection, I felt like this
project was a very interesting idea. Using this app,
it'll be easier to show other people your collection or
to navigate if you have a shoe you're willing to sell
that other people might purchase.
